source code for the backend of dl.kxtz.dev


## Running the server
First of all, DO NOT MODIFY Dockerfile! IT IS DYNAMICALLY GENERATED BY `docker.sh`!

Second, this *requires* Docker for security, and to run it is very simple, 

Prereq:
- Have Docker installed

Now, run
```
bash docker.sh
```

and wait for it to finish, now the file server should be running on localhost:3069!
